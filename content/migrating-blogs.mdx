title: Migrating from a custom Notion Blog

summary: A post about migrating from my custom Notion Blog to a MDX+Contentlayer blog.
---

I’m migrating my blogs. I used to write on Notion.
I built [a serverless Notion blog](https://github.com/arthtyagi/serverless-notion-blog)
to use Notion as my CMS and render all the content.
However, I much prefer writing plain markdown now. So, I’ll be using MDX and
Contentlayer for that. I also have a tool in the works to directly
write Markdown on my website or any other neat Markdown graphical
interface, push the change to my repo, and autodeploy the site.

My options currently are:

1. Write in Notion and then copy-paste to my repo in a new MD file.
2. Write my blog in my code editor.
3. Write in Obsidian and move around files.

I might be spending way too much time thinking this as I do with
most things but I prefer a seamless experience. I want to keep the solution low-overhead yet aesthetically pleasing simultaneously.
